# Heart Attack Prediction

## Overview

Heart Attack Prediction is a data science project aimed at predicting the likelihood of a heart attack based on various medical attributes and patient data. Leveraging machine learning techniques and data analysis within Jupyter Notebooks, this project provides insights and predictions to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and prevention.

## Features

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of heart-related health metrics.
- Preprocessing and cleaning of medical datasets.
- Implementation and comparison of machine learning models for prediction.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- Interactive visualizations within Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AarushGaikwad/HeartAttackPrediction.git
   cd HeartAttackPrediction
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the notebook file (e.g., `HeartAttackPrediction.ipynb`) to explore the code and run the analysis.

## Usage

- Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook to:
  - Load and preprocess data.
  - Train machine learning models.
  - Evaluate results using performance metrics.
- Customize the notebook to use your dataset or experiment with different machine learning algorithms.
