# Heart Attack Prediction

## Overview

Heart Attack Prediction is a data science project aimed at predicting the likelihood of a heart attack based on various medical attributes and patient data. This project leverages machine learning techniques and data analysis using Jupyter Notebooks to provide insights and predictions that could assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and prevention.

## Features

- Data exploration and visualization of heart-related health metrics.
- Preprocessing and cleaning of medical datasets.
- Implementation and comparison of machine learning models for prediction.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- Interactive visualizations in Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common Python data science libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (install via requirements.txt if provided)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AarushGaikwad/HeartAttackPrediction.git
   cd HeartAttackPrediction

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
